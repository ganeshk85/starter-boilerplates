### Git Local Commands

git status 
git add . 
git commit -m "any comment" 
git status 
git push production master:production 
git push remote-name local-branch-name:remote-branch-name 
git remote show origin - shows all the rmote info

To delete remote branch
git push remote-name --delete branch-name

To ignore files after .gitignore file has been created and committed.
1. Add the file in your .gitignore.
2. Run the following: git rm --cached <file> (warning: the file also gets deleted from the remote repository and local repository)
3. Commit the removal of the file and the updated .gitignore to your repo.

To list the conflicts while merging
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

If you are trying to ignore changes to a file that's already tracked in the repository 
e.g. a dev.properties file that you would need to change for your local environment but you would never want to check in these changes
git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
